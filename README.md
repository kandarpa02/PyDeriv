# Deriv 

Deriv is a highly efficient autodiff library with a NumPy-like API.

This is an early alpha release. APIs will change.

## Features

- Automatic gradient engine
- Efficient matrix ops
- NumPy-style syntax

## ðŸ§ª Autodiff in Action

Here's a sample forward and backward pass using Deriv:

![Deriv autodiff demo](assets/deriv_matmul.png)

The above code computes a composite function:

```
z = xy + x + 2 
h = ReLU(z) + x^2 
q = tanh(h) + 3y
f = q^2 + (z - h) + (A @ B)
```

Where:
- x = -3
- y = 1
- A = [2, -1]
- B = [[3], [1]]


This produces:
```
f = 8.0
df/dx = 42.0000
df/dy = -3.0000
df/dA = [3.0, 1.0]
df/dB = [[2.0], [-1.0]]
```

> ðŸ”¥ Deriv handles broadcasting, ReLU/Tanh activation, matrix multiplication, and complex chaining â€” all from scratch.

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer

Still under heavy development. Expect breaking changes. For now it only works on CPU.
